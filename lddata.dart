CRITICAL THINKING

a. All children have the right to quality education. How can we ensure this right to every child? Discuss the role of the government and the parents to make sure that every child can attend school. 

Answer:

Children are the future of the nation. For the development of the nation, it is very much essential for everyone to think about the right regarding education for every single child. All children should have the right to quality education. The education right for children is also mentioned in the constitution of most countries. The development of any nation depends on the literate. Thus, children's education can be taken as the beginning of this development.



In the context of our country, children's education has been given preferences by our government. The importance of children education has also been mentioned in our constitution. A huge budget has been sanctioned especially for children's education. But, there is still a lack of attendance of children in Nepali schools. The main reason behind this is the level of poverty in Nepal as well as the infrastructures of many schools. I think that it is very much important for the government to check all these essential things to uplift the condition of education. Education must be developed in such a way that children realize their right to quality education. The government should be active in the matter of children's education. It must move ahead with varieties of schemes especially for children in the school. It should provide attractive classrooms and textbooks, caring and talented teachers, scholarships and fine breakfasts etc. It should create a fine environment to make all children come to school more regularly. Apart from this, the parents at home must be attentive towards their children's education. They should play their vital roles to encourage their children to send them to their schools. If the government and the parents keep their attention on the above-mentioned things, every single child can attend school.



b. Do you think that there is still discrimination between sons and daughters in terms of providing education in our country? What strategies do you suggest to overcome such discrimination against girls? 

Answer:

Yes, I think that there is still discrimination between sons and daughters in terms of providing education in our country. Our country Nepal is a patriarchal country where we find males' superiority in most societies. In our societies, males are still considered as the heads of the families. Females aren't provided with many priorities. The concept of sex subjection is still prevalent everywhere. The girls' education in our societies depends on the patriarchal's decision. In comparison to the boys, girls get less chance in the matter of achieving an education. In rural societies, girls are forced to marry at their young ages. This is one of the biggest discriminations seen in societies for ages. I suggest the following strategies to overcome such discrimination against girls:

1. The government should launch strict rules against the early marriage of girls.

2. It should provide preferences to girls' education.

3. Girls should be encouraged to achieve education as boys.

4. Parents shouldn't bias girls in the matter of education.

5. The government should provide financial support to attract girls for education.

6. Girls shouldn't be forced into household tasks.

7. They should be provided with the right to quality education.

WRITING

School days are so precious days in the life of every individual. No one can forget their school days. On school days, we experience various things and events. In my case, there are a lot of events that I still remember. But, among all those events, I always remember a special event which I'm going to share with you.



The most interesting event of my school life was the day when I proposed to a girl named Gita of my class while I was in the eighth standard. I proposed to her through a love letter. I took the help of one of my poetic classmates named Harish. I was so scared at the beginning thinking much about possible ways to handle my letter.



When the second period's bell rang, I gave my letter to her just in front of the class's door without speaking a word. I was so worried as well as excited about the response to that letter. At the end of school time, she came to me with another letter. She handed me a letter and said love you in a smiling manner. I was so excited after hearing such lovable words from her mouth. That day was the beginning of my love. I never forget that valuable moment that once happened with me in my school.

CRITICAL THINKING 

a. How does the author persuade readers in this essay? What is he trying to communicate to the readers? 

Answer:

Here in this essay "Freewriting", the author persuades his readers using his various ideas, examples as well as supportive opinions. Here, the author has put forward his opinions related to writing skills and their improvements through the process of freewriting.



The author here in this essay has suggested his tips to improve writing skills for all his readers. According to him, the best way to improve writing skill is freewriting. Freewriting should be done repeatedly to enhance writing skills. He calls it automatic writing where a writer can put forward his/her feelings in a spontaneous way. Freewriting never accepts feedback. He further adds the most important part of free writing is 'non-editing'. For him, editing is the greatest obstacle in the writing process. The habit of compulsive and premature editing prevents the creativity of the writer. The process of writing becomes hard as well as dead through the process of editing. For the author, freewriting should be kept away from the editing process which hampers the authentic feelings and natural way of the writer. According to him, the main source of power in our writing is 'a voice' which includes a sound, a rhythm and a texture. It is the force that makes readers listen to the writers. It is the energy that drives the meanings into the thick skull.



b. Elbow said, freewriting “is an exercise in bringing together the process of producing words and putting them down on the page.” Do you agree with his statement? Why? Why not?

Answer:

Yes, I agree with his statement. Freewriting is an automatic writing process where the ideas of the writer can be seen in spontaneous ways. In this process, words are produced, brought together and put down on the page. This process can be done within a short period. In the process of freewriting, the writer must write spontaneously without thinking about different obstacles as grammar checks, spelling checks and so on. The writer must be away from the concept of editing. His/ Her writing flow must keep on moving with his/her free release of ideas. If freewriting is practised more often, the writer gets rid of editing worries.  Freewriting can overcome 'writer's block' by giving freedom to the writer's writing and undoing the ingrained habit of editing. 



c. How did you learn to write? What was particularly difficult in writing? What inspired you to write? What are some of the challenges that you still face while writing?

Answer:

I learnt to write by doing classwork writings and homework writings repeatedly. Grammar as well as spelling was particularly difficult in writing. Written articles related to stories, reports, news etc inspired me to write. There are some of the challenges that I still face which are as follows:

1. I feel hesitation while connecting more sentences.

2. Grammar still creates a lot of obstacles in my writing.

3. I feel difficulty in creating new ideas quickly.

WRITING 

C. Write a paragraph on any one of the following topics:

a. My school library

b. Moral values I like most 

                    My School Library 

Library refers to a place where we find different kinds of books and a peaceful environment to read. The library is the best place to achieve knowledge through reading varieties of books. In the library, people get a chance to read different kinds of books according to their choices. Most people prefer to read books in the library because of its peaceful environment. I also prefer to spend my time reading books in the library. I'm a student of grade eleven in Super International college. There is a fine facility of the library in my school. There are all sorts of books available in my school's library. I have become a member of my school's library. To get a membership card from the school's library, students need to pay five hundred rupees for a year. Our school's library has provided membership cards to all the members. Due to its facilities, I have got lots of advantages in my study. I have got answers to all my education-related queries from there. In the matter of making notes, understanding subject matter, my library has provided me with fine facilities. Thus, my school library is the best library which has helped me a lot in my studies.



                  Moral Values I Like Most

Moral values refer to those values which teach us the good aspects of life. Moral values make any individual perfect. These values make people good and positive in their attitudes and behaviours. These values keep people away from doing evil things in society. Most people learn these values from their homes as well as societies. Moral values include various essential aspects of a human's life as culture, religion, truthfulness, patience, obedience, honesty, integrity, hard work, responsibility, respect, tolerance, loyalty, public-spiritedness, freedom, respect for human life and dignity of persons. Others include justice, fairness and equality. All these things are very much important in everyone's lives. A person with all these qualities is considered to be a perfect human being. These moral values nourish people in a very well manner. Most of the successful people in the world are the outcomes of these values. If we follow these moral values in our lives, we won't feel any kind of difficulty in our life. Among all these above-mentioned moral values, I like responsibility the most. Responsibility makes people responsible for their duties. It makes people realise their duties towards their people. Most people get the proper way ahead in their lives only after being responsible. Those people who try to escape from their responsibilities in their lives, never get happiness and success in their lives. Thus, living a responsible life means living a perfect life.

People have been using social media for decades, especially for various purposes. These platforms have become successful to connect millions of people around the world. People in the world are getting a lot of benefits through its usage. 



In the past decade, there is excessive use of social media. Facebook and Twitter have grown much faster and captured millions of users in just a few years. The way technology is growing, it is clear that more and more people are going to grasp its benefits. It has brought a lot of advantages for society.



From developed nations to under-developed nations, every nation is utilizing the power of social media to enhance life and use it for the welfare of the people. Through social media people around the world have connectivity. Social media helps us in various ways:

However, on the other hand, it has also negatively affected society. Most people have become victims of cyberbullying such as spreading scams and fake news creating a fake account. Personal data and privacy are hacked easily. Making us addicted to it, our personal life is distracted. People are cheated and victimized by different social crimes. People are cheating and cheating in relationships. It has caused suicides because of harassment and blackmailing.



Just like anything which can be used for both good and bad, social media has also provided negative and positive ways for the people. It is all about the usage and getting things done positively by using the power of social media. It is in the hands of the user to use to its advantage. But willingly or unwillingly it can still have negative impacts on the users. In my case, l am quite satisfied with the use of such social media.

I am using it positively for my personal and social development.



b. What is cyberbullying? What are its effects? How can it be stopped? 

Answer:

Cyberbullying is the act of harassment in the form of digital media or devices. It is a modern term for maltreatment, which emerged with the rise of the internet and mobile devices. Cyberbullying takes place on digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets. It can take the form of texts through SMSes, online chat forums, social networking sites and gaming forums. Acts such as posting, sending or sharing negative content that is harmful, mean or obscene, defines cyberbullying. Cyberbullying can also take the form of illegal physical activities and unlawful behaviour. The internet is the place where cyberbullying is most common. Social media sites like Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram, to name a few are the most common sites for cyberbullying.



Cyberbullying leads to the increase of stress along with this it increased the anger in a person. People used to feel frustrated. Sometimes they have to suffer depression and because of this, they will start favouring isolation as most of the time they do by including harmful activities like drugs and alcohol. Most of the victims of cyberbullying feel alone as they have a fear of sharing the information they have feared to talk with a stranger. The victims used to fight and hurt themselves. Students who are suffering from cyberbullying are not interested to attend the classes as they don't feel comfortable because of the embarrassment and humiliation between their fellow students which results to give a negative impact on their results. Sometimes apart from the mental and physical effects, the effects of cyberbullying can ruin the health of the victim. He might get ill or may suffer from diseases like headache depression and sometimes by skipping meals may go through stomach problems and other diseases. Sometimes because of the high effect of cyberbullying a victim can also attempt suicide and some people who can't tolerate this type of situation feel like the best option to end all the problems is suicide.



Cyberbullying is a serious issue as it is very difficult for the person who is suffering from it. Now it is the duty of that person who is going through this situation to know how to handle it up by sharing the problem with their close ones. Victims must be identified and family members should support them.



Every teacher in the schools or colleges should provide awareness to their students about cyberbullying and other negative effects of social media. All the students should feel free to consult their teacher and parents about this serious issue. There are various laws established in the country because of the increase in cybercrime. Many countries have launched many laws, rules and regulations against cyberbullying. The rules are designed to protect the victims and keep the case information confidential. We find varieties government awareness programmes whıch aware people of cyberbullying.

IMPORTANT CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:

a) The Great Wall and the Taj Mahal are the creation of autocratic rulers. Present your view for or against this statement.

Answer:

I think that the autocratic rulers did their best tasks during their regimes in the past. Their contributions to the welfare of their states were outstanding. During that time, most of the autocratic rulers used to do tasks related to the development of their states. A sense of love towards their states was seen within them. They used to give priority to their kingdom at first. These two amazing creations are the most popular wonders of the world among seven wonders. 'The Great Wall of China' and 'The Taj Mahal of India' are still quite popular in the world due to their artistic creations. Both of the creations are the unique creations of autocratic rulers of China and India. The Qin dynasty of China and the Mugal dynasty of India had built these two different wonders during their regimes. The construction of these two great architectures had been possible through the Qin Shi's and Shah Jahan's autocratic regimes. These emperors had assigned thousands of workers, slaves, and peasants for the construction of these two great architectures. These two creations have made these two dynasties and their emperors immortal. In this modern time too, people remember these emperors for their outstanding achievements for their dynasties. Though the emperors were autocratic, they achieved huge success in their history. Their policies brought quite drastic changes during that time.



6) How do you describe the pros and cons of feudalism?

All of the students seemed quite busy. I asked one of the students from class 12 about the admission process as well as the principal’s office. He ushered me towards three stories building. I thanked him and moved towards there. While moving there, everyone kept eye on me smiling. I entered that building and moved up via stairs. Everywhere, I found only girls who were looking at me intently. I didn’t find any boys there. Finally, gathering some courage, I asked one of the beautiful girls named Rama about the principal’s office.

SUMMARY OF 👇

The Looking Glass by Anton Chekhov 

This story is about Nellie. She was the daughter of a landowner. She was young and beautiful. She was unmarried. She had a problem related to dreaming. She saw in her dream day and night of being married and was sitting in her room, gazing with tired half-closed eyes into looking glass. She would be motionless as looking glass. She could see many images one after another. It would be difficult to find out by looking at her image whether she was sleeping or awake. At first, she saw a beautiful smile, then a sweet expression of eyes in the grey background and then she saw a head, face, eyebrows, beard. It was the face of her expected one. He was her hope, fate, happiness, life and everything. Then she heard his voice, found herself living with him in the same house.



She saw many images in the gray background. She found herself knocking at the door of the district doctor at night. She heard the old dog barking behind the gate. It was dark and silent. At last, the garden gate opened. She saw the doctor's cook. She asked if the doctor was there but she replied that he was sleeping and gave an order to her not to wake up him. Then Nellie reached into the doctor's bedroom. The doctor was lying on his bed. Without speaking a single word, she sat down and started to cry.



She bitterly wept saying her husband was ill. But the doctor was lying on his bed. The doctor slowly sat up and looked at her with fixed sleepy eyes. She told him her husband was ill. She requested him to go with her. He told that he would come tomorrow. She again requested to doctor that it was urgent and her husband was going to die. The doctor replied that for last three days he had been away and he was not feeling well. Then the doctor slept again. She had been trying to make him understand her problem. Doctor asked her to go to another doctor Zemstvo. She replied that it was impossible because he lived away from there. She again requested him to make heroic deeds. But the doctor replied that it was impossible. He would not go. She threatened him to report to the court. At last, the doctor was ready to go. Nellie supported him searching coat. But after wearing the coat, the doctor again lay down. She got up and dragged him to the hall. At last, they started their journey. Earth was wrapped in darkness. The cold winter wind was blowing. They were silent all the way. At five in the morning, she was at home. She made him sit down on the sofa in the dining room and she went to see her husband. When she came back she found the doctor was lying down. He was serious. She decided to go to Zemstvo. There again followed darkness. She was suffering in body and soul. She remembered the past days with her husband. She realized that death was sure. At last, she found her husband was dying. She saw the coffin, the candles, and she even heard the footmark of an undertaker. She was so sad and she jumped up and when she opened her eyes she found there was looking glass on her feet. She looked at the looking glass and found a pale and tear-stained face. There was no grey background there. She thought that she was fallen asleep.

WRITING


Write a couple of paragraphs about an interesting dream that you have had. 

Answer:

Dream refers to the imaginary events seen in the mind while sleeping. Most people see dreams after they sleep. Dreams are so powerful and we can't have control over them. They are the consequences of our day to day activities. Last night I saw an interesting dream of a beautiful unknown girl who danced with me at one of my friends' party. In my dream, I saw myself at a birthday party of Ramesh, one of my friends. I saw myself sitting on the sofa in one of the corners. There were lots of unknown faces who were dancing. The environment of the room was so noisy. A group of girls approached me and started talking with me. I hesitated to talk with them at first. A bit later, a beautiful girl among them smiled at me and requested me to dance with her. I asked her name but she didn't reply to my question's answer. She started behaving with me in a quite familiar way. She held my hand and pulled me to the dance floor.




We started our dance. We danced for a long time holding each other's bodies. We had a lovable eyes connection. I felt so close to her. I kept on looking at her lovely face all the time while dancing. When I was about to ask her name, my interesting dream ended. My brother made me wake up in the morning time. I kept on thinking about that girl lying on my bed.

Present perfect and past simple

A. Notice the use of present perfect and past simple in the following text.

I think I have had a very interesting life. I'm 73 now and I don't work anymore. I was in the army for 31 years. I retired when I was 52. I have been to so many countries that I can't remember all of them. I've been to Australia six or seven times and to South Africa three times. I have also been once to Russia but I didn't like it at all: much too cold for me!



I've never been on television, but I've been on the radio once. It was a programme about life in the military about twenty years ago.

CRITICAL THINKING 

a. Are warmongers the greatest enemies for peace? What do you want to suggest to them?

Answer:

Yes, warmongers are the greatest enemies for peace. The term 'warmongers' refers to those profit-seekers who encourage or advocate revenge, aggression, enmity and wars. They always try their best to create upheavals as well as destructions. They are just against the concept of peace and humanity. They believe in creating conflicts every time. Due to warmongers, the world has faced numerous losses up to now. Warmongers are those who keep on making great conspiracies for great attacks or wars. They have different mentalities regarding their view of the world and its people. They feel good to see a massacre as well as a bloody environment. They always try their best to harm human existence. For them, the concept of humanity is just a mere word. They have different issues regarding their religion, country and groups. Their love for wars invites a dark future for humans' existence. These warmongers are the sole cause behind all the unfortunate events in the world.



I want to suggest to all these warmongers that things will reverse sooner. The pains which you have provided to numerous people, the same pains will be experienced by you too. Bad deeds are always punished. Your decisions and supporting acts for wars will surely make you feel regret one day. The pains and suffering of injured people, the cries of victims, the curses of humanity etc will never allow you to survive peacefully. Try to stop all your nonsensical ideas against humanity. Spread love and peace among humans so that humans can have peaceful and harmonious lives.  """

f. The writer says, "I worry that students today are more connected and more fragmented." Isn't this paradoxical? How?

Answer: 

The line " I worry that students today are more connected and more fragmented." is paradoxical.  This line has self-contradictory properties. As we know there is no fragmentation in connection but the above line suggests different meanings regarding the youths. In the present time, youths are connected virtually through social sites, but in the real world, they are quite far from each other. They don't have a person to person relation so they are fragmented. There is no exposure to each other to gain life's memorable moments.
